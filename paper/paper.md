# Summary
	
	DpRVI [@mandal2020dual], RVI [@Kim_2009]
	The plug-in is coded in Python and is dependant of the Quantum GIS framework. More 	specifically, it makes use of following libraries (bundled with Quantum GIS): numpy, gdal
	and QGIS core library
	
# SAR tools Audience
	**SAR tools** is intended for students, researchers and polarimetry experts who would like to utilize the QGIS and python ecosystem of diverse tools to derive different SAR descriptors. 

# SAR tools Functionality

The key functionality of **SAR tools** is organized into three modules:
- Full-pol:
- Compact-pol:
- Dual-pol:
